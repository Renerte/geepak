geepak is a quick, simple and memory-efficient (<2MB RAM for 18.5k files) utility for unpacking .pack archives, used by Tyler Glaiel's games such as The End is Nigh and Mewgenics.
You can use by running the command: `./geepak <archive file> [target directory]` or depending on the platform (at least Windows), by dragging the archive onto the executable in the file browser 😉

geepak currently doesn't support packing files into an archive, if that's something you need, you may use the [existing, alternative solution](https://github.com/ShootMe/GPAK-Extractor). It does however support a wide range of platforms, it will most likely run wherever you'll need it to 😊
