geepak is a quick, simple and memory-efficient (<2MB RAM for 18.5k files) utility for packing & unpacking .gpak archives, used in Tyler Glaiel's games such as The End is Nigh and Mewgenics.
You can use it by running the command: `./geepak <source archive/directory> [target directory/archive]` or depending on the platform (at least Windows), by dragging the archive/directory onto the executable in the file browser 😉
