geepak is a quick, simple and memory-efficient (<2MB RAM for 18.5k files) utility for unpacking .gpak archives, used in Tyler Glaiel's games such as The End is Nigh and Mewgenics.
You can use it by running the command: `./geepak <archive file> [target directory]` or depending on the platform (at least Windows), by dragging the archive onto the executable in the file browser 😉

geepak currently doesn't support packing files into an archive, if that's something you need, you may use the [existing, alternative solution](https://github.com/ShootMe/GPAK-Extractor). It does however support a wide range of platforms, it will most likely run wherever you'll need it to 😊
